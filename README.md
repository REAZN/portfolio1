# Portfolio 1

Part of three portfolios developed for a university assignment to evaluate the UI and UX of modern web design trends. Each portfolio has three sections, about, projects, and experiments. All three portfolios created contain the same information (text, images, icons, etc) as each other to keep the UX and UI of each site the primary focus of evaluation.

### Portfolio 1's key properties

- Reference portfolio to showcase a "safe" and traditional UX.
- Single-page with full user freedom of navigation.
- Light use of animations with fading sections and interactive elements.
- Dark colour scheme with a subtle accent colour.
